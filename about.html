      <h2>Brazil and the 5 Major Regions</h2>
      <p>This page was built with intention of sharing the various tradicional cuisines throughtout Brazil.</p> 
      <h3>North</h3>
      <p>In the North, mostly in Manaus, a very successful culinary brand is the X-Caboquinho, a tucumã sandwich with coalho cheese and fried pacovã banana. Açaí, a typical fruit of Amazonian palm trees, is widely used in the preparation of juices, wines, sweets, liqueurs and ice cream. Among the typical dishes of Pará are: vatapá made with salted shrimp broth and seasoned with basil, chicory, garlic and cheiro verde, in addition to the traditional tapioca, which are shaped like a pancake and can take various types of filling , such as chocolate, cheese or jam.</p>
      <h3>Northeast</h3>
      <p>In the region, the presence of traditional Afro-Brazilian cuisine is still very strong. It is possible to find various beans, yams, okra, smoked shrimp additions, ginger, peppers and vegetable oils such as palm oil, which form the basis of a table with acarajés, abará, fish and chicken vatapás, bobós , carurus, among many other dishes. The northeastern breakfast is quite varied, with cuscuz, tapioca, curau and coalho cheese on the grill as typical dishes, among others. For lunch, sun-dried meat with manioc is quite common in states like Rio Grande do Norte and Alagoas.</p>
      <h3>Midwest</h3>
      <p>Chicken with pequi, empadão goiano, fried or cooked mush, gueroba and baru are typical products of the cerrado and Goiás. The gastronomy of the cities that are in the Cerrado of Mato Grosso is a tasty mixture between the fruits of the region (pequi, banana, cashew and papaya) with the fish of the rivers of the region. The popular fruit of the Brazilian cerrado, added to the bank rice, results in one of the most symbolic dishes in the state, rice with pequi.</p>
      <h3>Southeast</h3>
      <p>In this region, each state has its specific cuisine. In Sao Paulo, like the pastel de bacalhau and the famous mortadella sandwich. In Espirito Santo, a traditional dish, the moqueca, one of the icons of the state's history, together with the clay pot in which the recipe is prepared according to indigenous tradition and the centuries-old custom of handmade pottery making. In Minas Gerais, there is a variety of artisanal cheeses and the famous cachaca.</p>
      <h3>South</h3>
      <p>In this region there are many varieties of barbecue and also fish cuisine. For example, oysters, sea bass or some shrimp dish, all very fresh. Santa Catarina's cuisine was also influenced by Polish, Ukrainian, Austrian, Hungarian and Dutch immigrants. While touring the communities where these settlers settled, it is possible to try typical dishes, such as potato soup with milk, potato pasties and curd, in addition to the traditional colonial coffee, which can be found in the city of Jaraguá do Sul.</p>
