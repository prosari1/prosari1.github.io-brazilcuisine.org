        <h2>Cachaca</h2>
        <p>Cachaca is a distilled spirit made from sugarcane juice, and is also known by the names aguardente, pinga de tuto, and caninha. It’s very cheap sugar cane alcohol produced throughout the country.</p>
        <p>Brazil has 4,000 brands of cachaca and produces 1 billion litres of the stuff every year. Made into Caipirinha with lime, sugar and crushed ice, it’s delicious but dangerous. It can do serious damage to your stomach and produces a lethal hangover. It is the most popular drink among Brazil’s poorest people and the national drink, second only to beer. It has been adopted in recent years as an “in” drink in the USA and Canada where the brands “cachaca 51” and “pitu” are popular.</p>
        <p>Cachaca is a cousin of the Spanish-Portuguese brandies, closely related to Italian grappa. Cachaca means “burning water” and there is nothing subtle about this drink. You can counteract the toxic taste by mixing it with pineapple, papaya or other tropical juice mixers. It is used in numerous drinks and cocktails like Nightboat to Brazil, lambada and Woody Woodpecker.</p>

        <h2>Feijoada</h2>
        <p>Feijoada is not only the national dish of Brazil, it’s the regional dish of Rio de Janeiro. But what the heck is it? Feijoada, at its core, is a hearty dish that consists of beans and salted pork or beef, and often includes vegetables too. The exact ingredients can vary though.</p>
        <p>The beans might be black, brown, or red. The meat could include bacon, smoked ribs, pork trimmings, smoked sausage, or jerked beef. The vegetables can be everything from carrots and cabbage to okra and kale. Feijoada is commonly served with rice;  it is often associated with holidays, celebrations, and other events, but it can also just be a solid midday meal. In the end, it’s the national dish, so there’s really no wrong way to eat it.</p>

        <h2>Churrascaria</h2>
        <p>The Brazilian barbecue tradition hails from the southern part of the country, from a gaucho technique of cooking meat in the wide-open country after a long day wrangling cattle. These days the wranglers come to you at the churrascaria, wielding skewers of meat from all manner of beast and bringing the cuts to your table one by one.</p>
        <p>There can be more than 20 different types of meat to choose from in the course of a meal at one of the big churrascarias.
          Each skewer-toting server approaches with a particular cut. You get not only a wide selection of cuts, but also styles: rare (mal passado), medium rare (a ponto para mal), medium (a ponto), medium well (a ponto para bem) and well done (bem passado).</p>
        <p>The hands-down favorite for Brazilians is picanha, a rump cut that's sliced in thin sheets and eaten with rice and beans. For anyone who wants to experience the Brazilian barbecue tradition, picanha is a must.</p>
